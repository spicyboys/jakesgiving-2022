	<h1>Entrées</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Traditional Roast Turkey</h2>
		<p>
			Your seasonal turkey cooked by the book: roasted low and slow (and another spatchcocked for
			good measure). Stuffed with apples, onions, and orange rinds, wrapped in seasoned pork belly,
			rolled in garlic-parsley-bay-leaf butter, and basted every 25 minutes to ensure these birds
			stay moister than an oyster.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Pork, Poultry</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2><i>Texas Honey Ham's</i> Honeyed Hams</h2>
		<p>
			Why make it yourself when they've got a smoker? Were <i>you </i> going to spend 12 hours
			smoking these meats just for it to be <i>almost</i> as good as Honey Ham's? We didn't think so.
			Enjoy.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Honey, Ham</p>
	</section>

	<h1>Sides</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Collard Greens with Turkey Drippings</h2>
		<p>
			Southern-style collard greens drizzled with unctuous turkey drippings. Also featuring poblano
			peppers, cayenne, and oven-roasted pork belly. True Jakesgiving OGs know this is the best item
			on the menu.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Chicken Stock, Gluten, Pork, Poultry, Soy</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Green Bean Casserole</h2>
		<p>
			Almost everything at Jakesgiving is made from scratch, but this is one that comes out of a
			can. Sure, you <i>could</i> lovingly raise your own fresh green beans and make your own cream of
			mushroom soup from scratch, but even that still ain't got shit on Campbell's.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Chicken Stock, Gluten, Milk</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Yukon Mashed Potatoes</h2>
		<p>
			Bring home the austere beauty of the Canadian Yukon with these tender golden potatoes, freshly
			whipped with roasted garlic, heavy cream, and a full stick of butter. It’s so authentically
			Canadian you might even start thinking you were supposed to be celebrating Thanksgiving last
			month.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Heavy Cream</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Sweet Potato Casserole</h2>
		<p>
			Roasted sweet potatoes with brown sugar and pecans, then tactically topped with a layer of
			marshmallows and toasted until it's just right. It’s the Thanksgiving equivalent of cookies
			for breakfast.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Gelatin, Gluten, Milk</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Traditional Cornbread Stuffing</h2>
		<p>
			A simple stuffing made with freshly baked cornbread and celery. Technically, we southerners
			call this “dressing” since, you know, it’s not actually <i>stuffed</i> anywhere. But we wouldn't
			want the carpetbaggers to feel unwelcome.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Chicken Stock, Milk</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Mac 'n Cheese</h2>
		<p>
			Developed in a lab by our sweatiest nerds, we've finally figured out how to take any cheese
			and make this classic dish work. Has science gone too far?
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Cheese, Gluten, Milk</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Shokupan Dinner Rolls</h2>
		<p>
			As they often do, the baking wizards of Japan took quite literally the most boring thing in
			the world and perfected it. Utilizing the innovative tangzhong method, this buttery milk bread
			is the same delicate, pillowy shokupan you've come to love, but in dinner roll form.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Eggs, Gluten, Milk</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Spiced Gravy with Pecans</h2>
		<p>
			Wholesome gravy with fresh turkey drippings, apple cider, and aromatics pulled straight from
			the bird — all poured right over crushed pecans.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Pork, Poultry, Pecans</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Homemade Spicy Cranberry Sauce</h2>
		<p>
			This no-can-will-do cranberry sauce is spiced with jalapeños, oranges, and cinnamon. We won’t
			have the cranberry cartel ruining <i>this</i> Jakesgiving.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Moral superiority. Proudly vegan.</p>
	</section>

	<h1>Desserts</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>Heirloom Pumpkin Pie</h2>
		<p>
			A layered pumpkin pie passed down from Helen’s grandmother, optimized for an increased
			pumpkin-to-cream ratio. Who said you couldn’t improve on tradition?
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Milk, Gluten</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Bourbon Cider Apple Pie</h2>
		<p>
			What's more American than apple pie? Putting bourbon in it, probably. Topped with an oatmeal
			cookie cumble, this is just the dessert for when you can't decide whether you want a pie, a
			cookie, or a stiff drink.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Alcohol, Butter, Eggs, Gluten</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>New York Cheesecake</h2>
		<p>
			We’ve kept Nich locked in a sunless room doing nothing but pumping out cheesecakes and quietly
			sobbing for nearly 22 months now, and this is all he’s got to show for it. A combination of
			real vanilla bean, toasted sugar, and full-fat cream cheese with creamy goat cheese, lemon
			zest, and a touch of orange blossom. And to top it all off, fresh berries and fruit compote
			sauce from scratch.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Butter, Cream, Cheese, Eggs, Gluten</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Pumpkin Bread</h2>
		<p>
			We’ve got one last maple-slathered, seed-topped, and deliciously spiced treat for you before
			pumpkins become unfashionable again for the next ten months. Besides, we had a lot of them
			left over after the last party.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Eggs, Gluten, Butter (optional)</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Cherry Pie</h2>
		<p>
			Cherry pie el clásico. It's really just an excuse to practice making pie crust. Might as well
			eat it anyway, we figure.
		</p>
		<p class="restrictions"><b>Contains:</b> Milk, Gluten</p>
